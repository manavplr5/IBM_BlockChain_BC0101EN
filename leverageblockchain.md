##### Why blockchain is relevant for business
- Saves time: Some processess like letter of creadit can take few days, but using blockchain we can reduce the time.

- Removes Cost: Internal and External audits in legacy systems has some overhead costs. This can be reduced by Blockchain.

- Reduces Risk: We reduces risk within the business network for tempering for fraud and cybercrime

- Improvement of Trust: We have increased level of trust because everyone uses the same way of storing the data in the business network. Participants endorse transactions.



##### Consensus: shared reference data example
- UseCase: The concept of rooted bank routing codes in the UK, where 6 banks decides whether your transaction can routed or not. and there are unique identifiers for the destination banks this is the example of shared reference data.

As of now, the different network of business keep there own copy of the reference data. Then they need to update the records based on different communication mediums.

- But, if we use Blockchain, we can control, who can access the data and who can actually get access to data.    


##### Provenance: supply chain example
- Usecase: Supply Chain of Automobile. where the parts or the subsystems have been travelling from manufactuerers to users. We can track who has done what with the asset.


##### Immutability: audit and compliance example
- ABN-AMRO who were a big dutch bank, they actually put their property protfolio onto blockchain to improve their audit. 

- On Blockchain, everything was locked together  and there is a complete trail of blockchain  




##### Finality: letter of credit example
- In US, their are more then 27 documents that needs to be submitted for credit balance from bank.
